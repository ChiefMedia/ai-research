    {
      "finding": "The overall campaign is significantly unprofitable, but high-performing segments offer a clear path to profitability.",
      "evidence": "The campaign's mean ROI is -0.81, meaning for every $1 spent, only $0.19 is returned. However, top stations like LIFETIME MOVIE NETWORK (ROI 0.43) and top dayparts like Weekend (WK, ROI 0.4) demonstrate strong positive returns.",
      "confidence": "high",
      "impact": "Shifting budget from underperforming to high-performing segments can transition the entire campaign from an $0.81 loss per dollar to a potentially profitable state, drastically improving overall ROI."
    },
    {
      "finding": "LIFETIME MOVIE NETWORK (LMN) is the most efficient station by a significant margin.",
      "evidence": "LMN delivers the highest ROI (0.43) and the lowest Cost Per Order ($111.95), which is 70% lower than the campaign's average CPO of $372.73. It also has the highest orders per spot (4.01).",
      "confidence": "high",
      "impact": "Increased investment in LMN could reduce the blended campaign Cost Per Order by hundreds of dollars per order and dramatically improve overall campaign profitability."
    },
    {
      "finding": "Weekend (WK) and Early Fringe (EF) dayparts, along with Saturday and Sunday, are significantly more cost-efficient than other time slots.",
      "evidence": "WK daypart has an ROI of 0.4 and a CPO of $121.55. EF daypart has an ROI of 0.3 and a CPO of $157.65. Saturday (ROI 0.26, CPO $196.45) and Sunday (ROI 0.23, CPO $197.54) are the top-performing days of the week.",
      "confidence": "high",
      "impact": "Reallocating budget to these periods offers the potential to reduce Cost Per Order by $150-$250 per order and substantially improve ROI compared to current campaign averages."
    },
    {
      "finding": "CPM (Cost Per Mille) for target demo impressions does not strongly correlate with conversion efficiency metrics (ROI, CPO, CPL, CPV).",
      "evidence": "Correlation analysis shows very weak correlations between 'cpm_target_demo' and 'cost_per_order' (0.026), 'cost_per_lead' (-0.02), 'cost_per_visit' (-0.034), and 'roi' (-0.04).",
      "confidence": "high",
      "impact": "This indicates that simply optimizing for cheaper impressions is not a primary driver of response efficiency. Focus should remain on performance-based metrics like Cost Per Order and ROI, regardless of CPM, to ensure effective media buying."
    },
    {
      "finding": "Late Fringe (LF) daypart and several specific stations (e.g., A&E Network, USA Network) are highly inefficient.",
      "evidence": "LF daypart has the worst Cost Per Order ($658.82) and lowest positive ROI (0.05) among significant dayparts. A&E Network ($593.75 CPO), USA Network ($504.88 CPO), and Hallmark Channel ($516.67 CPO) significantly exceed the campaign average CPO.",
      "confidence": "high",
      "impact": "Continued investment in these segments leads to substantial wasted spend. Reducing or eliminating spend here could prevent hundreds of dollars in cost per order for each conversion and free up budget for more effective placements."
    },
    {
      "finding": "Overnight (ON) daypart is profitable but has low orders per spot and may not scale well for significant growth.",
      "evidence": "ON has a positive ROI of 0.2 and CPO of $252.57, performing better than the overall campaign average. However, its orders per spot (0.64) are significantly lower than the top performing dayparts (WK 3.87, EF 3.39, EM 3.41, DA 2.93), aligning with the critical context that ON 'does not scale well'.",
      "confidence": "high",
      "impact": "While efficient for its cost, relying heavily on ON for scaling conversions would likely lead to diminishing returns and may not be the most effective strategy for aggressive CPO reduction and ROI growth compared to other higher-density dayparts."

      "expected_impact": "This reallocation is projected to substantially improve the overall campaign ROI, potentially moving it into profitability, and could reduce the blended Cost Per Order by $100-$200, depending on the scale of reallocation.",

      "priority": "high",
      "sample_size_caveat": "Based on 75+ spots for dayparts and 100+ spots for weekdays, providing high confidence."
    },
    {
      "action": "Immediately reduce or eliminate budget allocation to Late Fringe (LF) daypart and stations such as A&E Network, USA Network, and Hallmark Channel.",
      "rationale": "LF exhibits extremely poor efficiency (ROI 0.05, CPO $658.82), wasting significant budget. Similarly, A&E ($593.75 CPO), USA Network ($504.88 CPO), and Hallmark ($516.67 CPO) are substantially less efficient than the campaign average and top performers.",
      "expected_impact": "This action will prevent wasted spend on highly inefficient placements, freeing up capital that can be redirected to high-performing segments, thereby improving blended CPO and overall ROI by preventing orders at costs several times the optimal rate.",

      "sample_size_caveat": "Based on 10+ spots for each, providing high confidence."
    },
    {
      "action": "Shift optimization focus from CPM (Cost Per Mille) to Cost Per Order (CPO) and ROI.",
      "rationale": "The correlation analysis shows that CPM for target demo impressions has a negligible relationship with conversion efficiency. Relying solely on CPM for media buying may lead to suboptimal results.",
      "expected_impact": "By prioritizing CPO and ROI, media buyers will allocate budget based on actual business outcomes rather than just impression cost, leading to more profitable campaigns and more effective use of marketing dollars.",
      "priority": "high",
      "sample_size_caveat": "Based on correlation across all measured instances."
    },
    {
      "action": "Maintain, but do not aggressively scale, budget for Overnight (ON) daypart without further testing for scalability.",
      "rationale": "While ON is profitable (ROI 0.2, CPO $252.57) and contributes a large volume of spots, it has a low orders-per-spot metric and the critical context states it 'does not scale well'. Aggressive scaling might lead to diminishing returns or declining efficiency.",
      "expected_impact": "This conservative approach ensures that the campaign continues to leverage the existing efficiency of ON without risking a significant increase in CPO or reduction in ROI should its performance degrade at higher volumes.",
      "priority": "medium",
      "sample_size_caveat": "Based on 418 spots, providing high confidence, but considering the specific scaling caveat."
