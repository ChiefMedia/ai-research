SUMMARY:
Our TV campaign successfully drove $79,910 in revenue through 1,699 orders generated from 20,645 website visits originating from 825 TV spots. While a solid foundation, we need to compare these initial results against projected ROI to determine if the campaign is on track to meet or exceed revenue targets.

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Excellent engagement: 25.0 visits per TV spot
2. Top station LMN generated 6,954 visits from 164 spots
3. WK daypart shows highest efficiency at 46.1 visits per spot
4. Best combination: LMN + WK averaging 46.1 visits per spot

IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS:
• Reallocate budget from low-performing stations to LMN (Impact: High)
• Shift budget from LF to WK dayparts (Impact: High)
